# Fine-tuning

Learn how to customize your models on your data with fine-tuning.

## Introduction

Fine-tuning helps improve model performance by training on specific examples of prompts and desired responses. LLMs are initially trained on data collected from the entire internet. With fine-tuning, LLMs can be optimized to perform better in a specific domain by learning from examples for that domain. Smaller LLMs that have been fine-tuned on a specific use case [often outperform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15334) larger ones that were trained more generally.

Fine-tuning allows for:

1. Higher quality results than prompt engineering alone
2. Cost savings through shorter prompts
3. The ability to reach equivalent accuracy with a smaller model
4. Lower latency at inference time
5. The chance to show an LLM more examples than can fit in a single context window

LLM Engine's fine-tuning API lets you fine-tune various open source LLMs on your own data and then make inference calls to the resulting LLM. For more specific details, see the [fine-tuning API reference](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.FineTune).

## Producing high quality data for fine-tuning

The training data for fine-tuning should consist of prompt and response pairs.

As a rule of thumb, you should expect to see linear improvements in your fine-tuned model's quality with each doubling of the dataset size. Having high-quality data is also essential to improving performance. For every linear increase in the error rate in your training data, you may encounter a roughly quadratic increase in your fine-tuned model's error rate.

High quality data is critical to achieve improved model performance, and in several cases will require _experts_ to 
generate and prepare data - the breadth and diversity of the data is highly critical. Scale's Data Engine can help 
prepare such high quality, diverse data sets - more information [here](https://scale.com/rlhf).

## Preparing data
Your data must be formatted as a CSV file that includes two columns: `prompt` and `response`. A maximum of 100,000 rows of data is currently supported. At least 200 rows of data is recommended to start to see benefits from fine-tuning.

Here is an example script to create a 50-row CSV of properly formatted data for fine-tuning an airline question answering bot

## Making your data accessible to LLM Engine
Currently, data needs to be uploaded to a publicly accessible web URL so that it can be read for fine-tuning. Publicly accessible HTTP, HTTPS, and S3 URLs are currently supported. Support for privately sharing data with the LLM Engine API is coming shortly. For quick iteration, you can look into tools like Pastebin or Github Gists to quickly host your CSV files in a public manner. We created an example Github Gist you can see [here](https://gist.github.com/tigss/7cec73251a37de72756a3b15eace9965). To use the gist, you can just use the URL given when you click the “Raw” button ([URL](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tigss/7cec73251a37de72756a3b15eace9965/raw/85d9742890e1e6b0c06468507292893b820c13c9/llm_sample_data.csv)).

## Launching the fine-tune
Once you have uploaded your data, you can use the LLM Engine's [FineTune.Create](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.fine_tuning.FineTune.create) API to launch a model fine-tune. You will need to specify which base model to fine-tune, the locations of the training file and optional validation data file, an optional set of hyperparameters to customize the fine-tuning behavior, and an optional suffix to append to the name of the fine-tune.

If you specify a suffix, the fine-tune will be named `model:suffix:<timestamp>`. If you do not, 
the fine-tune will be named `model:<timestamp>`. The timestamp will be the time the fine-tune was 
launched.

<details>
<summary>Hyper-parameters for fine-tune</summary>

* `lr`: Peak learning rate used during fine-tuning. It decays with a cosine schedule afterward. (Default: 2e-5)
* `warmup_ratio`: Ratio of training steps used for learning rate warmup. (Default: 0.03)
* `epochs`: Number of fine-tuning epochs. (Default: 5)
* `weight_decay`: Regularization penalty applied to learned weights. (Default: 0.001)
* `max_seq_length`: Maximum number of tokens per sequence in the dataset. (Default: 1024)

=== "Create a fine-tune in python" 

```python
from llmengine import FineTune

response = FineTune.create(
    model="llama-7b",
    training_file="s3://my-bucket/path/to/training-file.csv",
)

print(response.json())
```

See the [Model Zoo](../../model_zoo) to see which models have fine-tuning support.

Once the fine-tune is launched, you can also [get the status of your fine-tune](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.fine_tuning.FineTune.get).

## Making inference calls to your fine-tune

Once your fine-tune is finished, you will be able to start making inference requests to the 
model. You can use the `fine_tuned_model` returned from your 
[FineTune.get](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.fine_tuning.FineTune.get)
API call to reference your fine-tuned model in the Completions API. Alternatively, you can list 
available LLMs with `Model.list` in order to find the name of your fine-tuned model. See the 
[Completion API](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.Completion) for more details. You can then 
use that name to direct your completion requests.  You must wait until your fine-tune is complete 
before you can plug it into the Completions API. You can check the status of your fine-tune with 
[FineTune.get](../../api/python_client/#llmengine.fine_tuning.FineTune.get).
